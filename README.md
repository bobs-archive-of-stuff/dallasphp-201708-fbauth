# Adding Facebook Auth as an Afterthought

This is a little example application which uses Facebook authentication to log
in and create new users on the fly. While it is not designed to the base of
your next one million dollar project, the Auth router at the very least should
be of interest to see how to step through the Facebook process.

Requires: PHP 7.1, PHP PDO w\ SQLite3.
